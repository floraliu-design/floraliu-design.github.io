<h5 class="indent">OVERVIEW</h5>
<p class="indent">As a Digital Design Intern at Aetna during my 2019 summer, I was able to partake in and shadow a lot of the work the team did on the Attain by AetnaSM app. The Attain app is a health experience designed in collaboration with Apple; it combines your health history with your Apple Watch¬Æ activity in order to create personal goals and challenges promoting long-term health. This benefits Aetna in the sense that members lead better lifestyles, and become lower risk as members of Aetna.</p>

<p class="indent">The Attain app separates themselves through their uniquely ‚Äúrealest‚Äù tone. They like to refer to the app as a health ‚Äúexperience‚Äù, and understand that their users don‚Äôt all want to (or can) run a marathon, they just want to live a better life. Attain wants to be supportive of all fitness and lifestyle goals, not just extreme, near-impossible ones.</p>

<br>
<h5 class="indent">THE CHALLENGE</h5>

<p class="indent">Through user research, the Attain team found that users wanted to be updated on: </p>
<p class="numlist"> 1. How they were doing with their health goals. </p>
<p class="numlist"> 2. How they were doing in comparison to other Attain users. </p>

<br>
<h5 class="indent">DEVELOPMENT</h5>
<p class="indent">Before any designing or feature selection was to be done, I quickly defined a few things I knew were essential to our solution in order to keep the Attain style.</p>
<p class="indent"> 1. Personalization - Users have to feel special and feel like the data and summary must be tailored for them specifically, and they are not just part of some lump-sum fitness program.</p>
<p class="numlist">a. After meeting with Attain‚Äôs data team, we took our first step towards accomplishing personalization. We determined that according to Attain user data, the best way to split the pool of users was into three categories: 1. the Top 60th Percentile of users, 2. the Bottom 60th, and 3. Those who achieved no goals.</p>
<p class="indent"> 2. Real data-Attain works heavily with a team of doctors and data scientists to tailor goals to the user, so user data is a must in showing users how they are doing.</p>
<p class="numlist">a. After meeting with Attain‚Äôs data team, we were able to determine what statistics can be easily pulled from user‚Äôs profiles to help strengthen our solution: How many daily goals, weekly goals, and healthy actions were achieved within the month, and how many points were earned as a result.</p>
<p class="indent"> 3. Retain positive tone - Whether they‚Äôre the best of the best, or slacking on their goals, the ‚Äúrealest‚Äù tone is supportive and motivating of all users.</p>
<p class="numlist">a. Luckily, the Aetna digital team has a great team of copy writers that helped me later on in the process in coming up with headlines and copy that would get the message across while retaining Attain‚Äôs unique tone. </p>

<br>
<h5 class="indent">FEATURE SELECTION</h5>
<p class="indent">Before designing anything, I had to determine exactly what I was designing. Would it be a direct mail pamphlet? A pop up phone notification? An email? SMS Alert? With this question, we had to evaluate the 4 internal and external outlets Aetna had towards Attain app users: In-App/Mobile Notifications, Direct Mail, Email, Text Message Alerts.</p>

</div>
<div class="column">
<img class="rightimg" src="images/feature_graph.png" alt="Feature Graph"/>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">It was concluded that email would produce the greatest impact, all while being the most accessible. It is the least constraining and allows the most visual/interactive content, all while reaching users in a quick, prominent way.</p>

<br>
<h5 class="indent">EVALUATING EACH AUDIENCE</h5>

<p class="indent">Once our three main user groups were determined, I made sure to evaluate each group‚Äôs needs and emotions in order to get myself into the mindset of designing personalized, targeted content.</p>

<img class="projectimg" src="images/audience_chart.png" alt="Audience Chart"/>

<br>
<h5 class="indent">CONTENT REQUIREMENTS</h5>
<p class="numlist">1. Headlines/Body copy (Personalized to fit each group)</p>
<p class="numlist">2. Goals achieved within the month</p>
<p class="numlist">3. Points achieved within the month</p>
<p class="numlist">4. Visual elements/style from Attain</p>
<p class="numlist">5. Basic email components</p>

<br>
<h5 class="indent">INITIAL DESIGN PROCESS</h5>

        <br>
        <p style="padding-top: 20px; padding-left: 50px;text-align: left; padding-right: 150px;">With the content requirements in mind, I designed three major components to help piece together my email. </p>
        <br>
        <p style="padding-left: 70px;text-align: left; padding-right: 180px;">1. Headline & secondary headlines: Playful headlines that capture the Attain voice and get the message across.</p>
        <br>
        <p style="padding-left: 70px;text-align: left; padding-right: 180px;">2. Completed & earned statistics: Breaks down how many daily/weekly/healthy goals achieved and how many points were earned as a result. </p>
        <br>
        <p style="padding-left: 70px;text-align: left; padding-right: 180px;">3. Closing copy and Attain wave: Closing lines to reiterate the message in the Attain voice, laid over the Attain wave to incorporate visual elements and style from the mobile app.</p>
    </div>

        <div class="column c3">
            <p style="padding-left: 280px; padding-top: 150px; text-align: left;"> The resulting design:</p>
            <p style="padding-left: 300px; text-align: left;">‚úÖ Headlines/Body copy</p>
            <p style="padding-left: 300px; text-align: left;">‚úÖ Goals achieved within the month</p>
        <p style="padding-left: 300px; text-align: left;">‚úÖ Points achieved within the month</p>
        <p style="padding-left: 300px; text-align: left;">‚úÖ Visual elements/style from Attain</p>
        <p style="padding-left: 300px; text-align: left;">‚úÖ Basic email components</p>
        <p style="padding-left: 300px; text-align: left;">üåü Real data</p>
        <p style="padding-left: 300px; text-align: left;">üåü Positive, "realest" tone </p>

        </div>
    </div>

    <h5 class="indent">ITERATIONS</h5>
    <p class="indent">After finishing the initial designs and showing them to the rest of the Attain team, I felt that there was still room for improvement to make the impact of this email even stronger.</p>

    <p class="numlist">Some problems I would like to address: </p>
    <p class="numlist">1. Could I make it even more motivating? </p>
    <p class="numlist">2. Could I make it even more positive? </p>
    <p class="numlist">3. Is it easy enough for Attain‚Äôs target audience to read? </p>
<br>

<div class="row">
        <div class="column c3">
            <img style="width: 70%; height: auto; padding-left: 230px; padding-right: 30px;" src="images/revised_elements.png" alt="Initial Elements"/>
        </div>
        <div class="column c3">

            <p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 50px;text-align: left; padding-right: 150px;">With these problems in mind, I revised and/or created new elements to help improve the email layout. </p>
            <br>
            <p style="padding-left: 70px;text-align: left; padding-right: 150px;">1. New "Completed" Layout: This new layout has the goals and healthy actions achieved in a left to right fashion which is more clear and more easily readable. Moreover, it is made separate from the "Earned" to strengthen the visual hierarchy, emphasizing that the "Completed" contribute towards the points "Earned". </p>
            <p style="padding-left: 70px;text-align: left; padding-right: 150px;">2. Prominent "Earned" Number: I chose to make the "Earned" points a separate element and make it a larger number. The large, white number stands out and the total points number is significantly smaller, making the user feel like they achieved a lot, even if they only received 2,000 out of 12,000 points this month, for example. I felt that this helped retain a positive tone to the email, even towards those in the lower percentile.</p>
            <p style="padding-left: 70px;text-align: left; padding-right: 150px;">3. Monthly Summary Screen: I wanted to incorporate an extra visual element that would strengthen the message of the email and help users understand their statistics more. This would be a screenshot of their monthly summary/progress screen within the app.</p>

        <p style="padding-left: 300px; text-align: left;">1. "Earned" Points is a large, contrasting, prominent number.</p>

    </div>

    <h5 class="indent">PERSONALIZATION AND THE FINAL PRODUCT</h5>
    <p class="indent">With the help of the wonderful copy writers on our team, we were able to come up with personalized headlines and body copy personalized for each target percentile. We made sure it was playful and ‚Äúrealest‚Äù, and it added a whole other dimension to the final product. </p>

    <h5 class="indent">REFLECTION</h5>
    <p class="indent">Attain by Aetna has made me see the worth and inspired me to create technology that will make lasting effects on users, such as improving one's long-term health. Some specific insights gained from this email project:</p>
    <p class="numlist">1. Design with technical constraints in mind: Throughout this design process, I have learned that there are many hurdles and obstacles that the designs I initially came up with had to overcome. Some major things I had to keep note of were that the email would be built in Stripo, and I had to design in a way that the layout was feasible. I also had to make sure that any data I wanted to incorporate was feasible for Attain's data team to pull. </p>
    <p class="numlist">2. Anything can go through a product thinking process! Even with this digital piece, I found that using common UI/UX practices helped clarify who and what I was designing for, helping make sure the end result was impactful. </p>
    <p class="indent">I am so lucky to have been put on such an amazing digital team for the summer and been able to shadow such an impactful product. Special thanks to the Attain team for helping me throughout this project and I will miss being apart of the "Pixel Peeps" üòä. </p>
